# DataLab3.7
A datalab guiding the student through java data managing. 
This project follows the Activity 3 guide of the datalab, teaching the student how to access live databases and organize them using a class and use them in an algorithm.
In Welcome 01 we connect and load a database and fetch some of its values.
In Welcome 02 we put our data in observation objects and display it and even find out the coldest object.
In Welcome 03 we work with the weatherstation class to create an arraylist of weatherstation objects for all our data. We can even find out how many stations are in a certain state.
The sinbad filehelps us connect to these live databases and manage them.
